# Aaron

Hello my name is Aaron. I was born and raised in Thornton Colorado, about a 30 min drive from Boulder. I'm currently majoring computer science and am excited for what the future of me education looks like! I am big into music and sports. I played basketball and frisbee, and watch a lot of football and basketball!
